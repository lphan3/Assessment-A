GitHub Assessment - Week 3
Task:
1.	Get the starter file from my repository.
2.	Edit it with your name.
3.	Push it to your own repository named Assessment-A.

Step 1: Clone my repository
Open your terminal (Git Bash, Command Prompt, or VS Code Terminal):
# Go to Desktop (or any folder you want)
# Clone my repo
git clone https://github.com/lphan3/Assessment-A.git
# Move inside the cloned project
cd < Assessment-A >

Step 2: Edit the file
•	Open the file index.html in your editor.
•	Find the line:
<p>Hello - My name <Your-Name></p>
•	Replace <Your-Name> with your actual name.
•	Save the file.

Step 3: Push to your own repo
***ATTENTION***: Before Push to your own repo, you need to remove the old “remote” first in order to link the folder to the new Repo:  
# Remove the link to my repo
git remote remove origin 			
Now you’ll push this updated file into your own repository. Name your Repository as Assessment-A
